## 🎯 Quick Paths

### “I want to start building AgentFS”
1. Read **Buildplan.md**
2. Read **Architecture.md**
3. Read **DataModel.md**
4. Set up via **SERVICES.md**
5. Implement API per **API.md**
6. Use **Testing.md** to keep CI green

### “I want to evaluate whether this is a good idea”

## 🧭 MVP scope reminder

MVP explicitly excludes:
- WebSockets/subscriptions
- Sharing/ACLs across tenants
- Solana/on-chain ownership
- Deep workspace indexing

Those are roadmap items only after the MVP is stable and adopted.


## Added integration docs

- **USERFLOW.md** — layman explanation + runtime flows
- **TELEGRAM_INTEGRATION.md** — Telegram bot integration patterns
- **PHASE_FILE_MAP.md** — which files belong to which build phase
